Credit Card Risk Prediction using XGBoost-
This project predicts the risk associated with credit card holders using machine learning, specifically an XGBoost classifier. It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model building, and evaluation metrics.

ğŸ“‚ Project Structure
EDA: Data visualization and insights.
Preprocessing: Feature scaling and label encoding.
Modeling: Training an XGBoost Classifier.
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

ğŸš€ Technologies Used
Python 3
Google Colab
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn
XGBoost

ğŸ“ˆ Dataset
Name:[risk credit card(Data).csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19944807/risk.credit.card.Data.csv)
